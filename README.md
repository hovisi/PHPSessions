# PHPSessions
My project will incorperating logging in, so the user (who in this case will be a student) can see a table that lists classes available to them, the description, the time they are held, and the location. There will also be a logout page that can be reached when the student logs out of their account.

The flow of this assigment will be: Login page --> (properly loggin) --> classlistings page --> (loggout of account) --> loggout page
